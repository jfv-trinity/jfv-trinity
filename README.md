Hi, Iâ€™m Joseph Volpe.
Iâ€™m interested in backend developement and more specifically working with Python. I would love to work with anything game or mobile as well.
For now i am focused on gaining experience to be a better developer and be able to work remotely.
Iâ€™m currently learning at Centennial College, gaining experience with mutliple languages. So far the most satisfying course other than Python was Mobile Development.
