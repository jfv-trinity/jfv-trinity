- 👋 Hi, I’m @jfv-trinity
- 👀 I’m interested in backend developement and more specifically Python. I would love to work with anything related to AI's in the future. 
For now i am just focused on gaining experience.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning at Centennial College, gaining experience with mutliple languages. So far the most satisfying course other than Python was Mobile Development.
- 💞️ I’m not actively looking to collaborate but if it interesting and i have time then i would down for the challenge.
